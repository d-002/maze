## Overview
This project is a Python game where you try to find the exit gate to a maze and go to the next level, where a bigger maze will be waiting for you. Yet beware, evil monsters will try and stop you from doing so!

There is an infinite amount of levels, with a random generation every time, generated by an algorithm coded for a school project.

Other than the main file, you can also find two other python files: `entities.py` (entities handling) and `maze.py` (maze generation).  
The remaining `.py` files were used in the development process in order to resize images. You don't need them.

## Handling and options
Pan with the mouse, left click to attack and right click to open doors.  
WASD to move around.

### Editing options
You can edit the file `files/options.txt` to change settings like the keys used to move (order: up, left, down, right), the FOV or the render distance.

You don't want to increase the render distance, as the fog will hide most of the far away parts of the maze.  
It is also very unlikely that long straight paths would generate, which would be the only reason why you would need high rander distance.  
I recommend to only change this setting if you want to lower it, for example if you are playing on a potato.

### Defaults
- **move_keys**: wasd
- **fov**: 70
- **render_distance**: 20

You can also delete the `options.txt` file to revert everything back to default.
